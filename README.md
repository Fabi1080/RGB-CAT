RGB-CAT
=======
RGB Color-Adjustment-Tool
-------------------------

This small java tool enables a fullscreen window filled with a RGB Color.

It includes the following features:

* manually decrease/increase color
* manually set color constants red, green and blue
* set increment step size/color changing interval
* auto increment colors
* changing speed of the auto increment


## What is it for?

I wrote this tool to better check gamma curves and color settings of monitors and other screens.

It runs on every device supporting Java and the Eclipse SWT ([The Standard Widget Toolkit](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/) ) and can be used for all screens able to be attached to those.

Here are a few examples:
* check gamma curves of monitors
* check gamma curves of televisions
* check Ambilight colors
* check screens for defective pixel
